      "Few auto stocks have ever excited investors like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). The innovative electric-car maker and its CEO, Elon Musk, have won legions of fans and plenty of customers with groundbreaking -- if not always perfect -- upscale battery-powered vehicles.\n",
      "Taking a page from Tesla's book, Chinese start-up NIO (NYSE: NIO) emerged last year with a handsome upscale electric SUV and big plans for more. Investors hoping to make money from electric-vehicle sales in China flocked to NIO's shares -- at least for a while.\n",
      "But for both companies, the stories have shifted in the last year, and not in good ways. Shares of both Tesla and NIO have declined since the beginning of 2019. With concerns about auto sales rising around the world, it's time to ask: Is either of these companies a good buy for new money now?\n",
      "Neither company's stock has had a good year, but Tesla's year hasn't been nearly as bad as NIO's:\n",
      "\n",
      "TSLA data by YCharts.\n",
      "When it comes to valuations, traditional metrics don't really apply to either company. They're both what we call \"story stocks,\" companies with valuations driven by expectations of future growth and profitability.\n",
      "Those expectations are in turn driven by the stories -- the future possibilities that we might see for these businesses, not the current businesses themselves. For example: A fundamental-minded investor might look at Tesla and see a money-losing automaker that continues to struggle with quality and service issues. That company probably isn't worth much, relatively speaking.\n",
      "But if we believe (for example) that Tesla is poised to become one of the world's largest-selling and most-profitable automakers by 2025 or so, then we could argue that its valuation should be driven by those expectations and not by the current reality.\n",
      "It's the expectations that have given Tesla a $44 billion market cap, not the current reality. And Tesla's share price -- and NIO's -- have risen and fallen as those expectations have shifted over time.\n",
      "Right now, Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Tesla to lose $3.47 per share in 2019, on average, on revenue of $24.7 billion. But they expect things to turn around in 2020, when they believe Tesla will report $4.02 per share in profit on revenue of $30.3 billion.\n",
      "In a nutshell, the story that is driving those expectations goes something like this:\n",
      "Tesla's Model 3 is selling well, but how much demand remains? Image source: Tesla.\n",
      "Of course, that story has developed some cracks:\n",
      "As I see it, all of the questions about Tesla's story boil down to these two:\n",
      "I suspect the answers to those questions are \"no\" and \"yes,\" respectively. If I'm right, then Tesla's stock is unlikely to beat the market over the next few years. If not -- specifically, if it can maintain sales growth for a while longer -- then its stock might still outperform.\n",
      "NIO's story is a little simpler. Sales of its first mass-produced product, the 7-passenger ES8 SUV, were good in the first months after its launch in June of 2018. NIO followed up the ES8 with a smaller upscale electric crossover called the ES6, which compared well with Tesla's Model 3 on paper -- and sales of that model have been decent since its launch a few months ago.\n",
      "But NIO has spent a lot of money getting this far, quite a bit more than it should have. Now, it's in a cash crunch: The company had just $503.4 million in cash remaining as of June 30, after having burned about $620 million in the second quarter as it geared up to launch the ES6.\n",
      "NIO is hoping that sales of its new ES6 crossover will deliver enough cash to keep it going. Image source: NIO.\n",
      "NIO did announce a deal to raise $200 million in September, and its third-quarter sales were good, but that's probably not enough. A key analyst thinks the company will run out of cash before the end of the year unless it's bailed out by a big investor or the Chinese government. CEO William Li said in September that the company was working on a new financing package, but as of this writing no details have surfaced.\n",
      "Right now, NIO's shares are probably best thought of as an option on the possibility that it will manage to survive without a trip through China's equivalent of bankruptcy court.\n",
      "Here's the thing: Autos are a cyclical business. Auto sales rise and fall with consumer confidence, and automakers' profits rise and fall with sales. Because automakers -- even innovative electric-vehicle makers like Tesla and NIO -- have such high fixed costs, a moderate decline in sales can be enough to entirely erase even a financially strong automaker's profits. And given the age of the current cycle, a significant decline seems likely in the not-too-distant future.\n",
      "Given that neither of these companies is sustainably profitable now, it's hard to make a case for either under the circumstances. If you believe in Tesla's longer-term growth story, and think that it's likely to muddle through whatever economic storms lie ahead without a trip through bankruptcy court, then it might not be a terrible buy at current prices. But if sales start to slip, you might be able to buy it for much less in a few quarters.\n",
      "As for NIO, at this moment it feels like a long shot. I suggest avoiding NIO stock, at least until the company's near-term financial fate is clear.\n",

      "No, it's not the same as Ford vs. Ferrari, but the choice of investments between Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) or Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) comes down to blue-chip value that under-performs versus big speculative growth. The only thing that truly makes Tesla different from the established car names is its reliance purely on electric engines. Some could point to things like the solar panel business, or energy storage, but 89.4% of third quarter revenues stemmed from car sales. This is a car company. Yet, the shares are valued as if it is something else. The EV factor is becoming less and less important, as the majority of automakers are adding electric models to their lineups to go along with their traditional cars.\n",
      "https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/47313d21-3cac-4f69-9497-d161bce15da4\n",
      "So your choice depends on your style of investing and your overall strategy. Many investors who favor Tesla believe in a monumental shift, in which traditional automakers are being outmaneuvered by the \"genius\" of Elon Musk. The opposite school would say that Tesla isn't doing anything that the established names can't do as well; to that end, Ford carries the same potential, with a cheaper\n",
      "Ford's appeal all comes down to one word: dividends. The stock yields 6.43% right now, and has a history of established dividend payments that Tesla can't offer. Outside of that dividend, the stock has been a complete dud. Over the last decade share have drastically under-performed the S&P 500.\n",
      "In a comparison of revenue, Ford's growth rates are much lower than Tesla's. Ford's annual growth has been between 1.5% and 3.8% through the last few years; that pales in comparison to Tesla's 82% revenue gain in 2018. Of course, the flip side here is that Ford did $160 billion in sales in 2018, and Tesla did a little over $21 billion. The stock garners so much attention because of the company's growth rates, and its speculated potential.\n",
      "Image source: Getty Images.\n",
      "Earnings: Over time, Ford has been much more profitable, thanks to its more established nature and infrastructure; it's the better investment if you're looking for stability. Through the first nine months of the year, the company had net income attributable to stockholders of $1.72 billion, while Tesla had losses of $967 million through the same time period.\n",
      "Stock performance: Over the last decade, Tesla shares have absolutely been the more successful play, increasing by 1,872% during that time; investors who got in at the beginning with Tesla are very happy people. In comparison, Ford shares have followed the trend of most major automakers, remaining at basically the same price levels as ten years ago.\n",
      "Ford is a far more established player in the car world, so investors treat the stock very differently than Tesla. Most of the big names like Ford, General Motors, or Toyota trade at very low price-to-earnings ratios. Sales and earnings mean a great deal to the way markets treat these stocks. In other words, investors aren't willing to pay big premiums, resulting in the stocks under-performing the market.\n",
      "Tesla, on the other hand, has been treated with the attitude usually reserved for major tech stocks. The investment is predicated on electric vehicles happening very fast, and Tesla managing to outperform the plethora of EV options being put onto the market from established names. The market has demonstrated that investors are in love with the story, and the stock's volatility means it can experience big gains on good news.\n",
      "These two stocks fall into such different investing strategies that to compare them as \"this one vs. that one\" feels a bit shortsighted. I personally dislike them both.\n",
      "Ford is a blue chip that's an important player in the auto industry, but its shares are traded conservatively to say the least. It's a more diversified company, with great strength in the coveted pickup-truck market in the United States, but that diversification has hurt the company a bit, as traditional sedan sales plummeted to the point of being phased out. The big card for Ford is its financial stockpile of over $20 billion. It's just not clear what the company is going to do with it. \n",
      "I'm not a Tesla investor because I don't like speculation; Tesla's pricing is very high for a company that doesn't currently produce profits. There was a little over $6 billion in shareholder's equity on the balance sheet at the end of the third quarter. In comparison, the stock carries a market capitalization of $80 billion. Where's the value? There aren't any earnings, so the performance of the stock is entirely predicated on sales growth and the promise of a grand future. The problem there is the stock is already priced for that future.  \n",
      "The moral of the story: Investing in Ford is an inefficient use of capital. The stock lags the market. Investing in Tesla has produced big returns over the past decade, but the financials behind the company don't really support what the stock has done. Ten years ago this stock was a steal. That is no longer true.\n",

      "(RTTNews) - Tesla's market capitalization briefly crept up the $100 billion mark in extended trading on Tuesday, making it the first publicly-listed automaker in the U.S. to achieve the feat.\n",
      "Tesla's stock gained 7.2 percent to close Tuesday's regular trading session at $547.20, and rose a further 1.4 percent to $555 in after-hours trading, pushing the luxury electric car maker's market valuation to more than $100 billion.\n",
      "The gain was recorded after brokerage New Street Research raised the company's twelve-month price target to $800, from  $530. Analyst Pierre Ferragu forecast that Tesla will deliver 2 million to 3 million cars annually after 2025.\n",
      "While Tesla is already the most valuable U.S. automaker, the achievement took it close to toppling German automaker Volkswagen as the second-most valuable car company in the world.\n",

      "Tesla, Tesla, Tesla (TSLA). It’s the hottest stock on the market, and people can’t stop talking about it. TSLA is an enigma to the markets and the bane of traders. The markets have made and lost billions on this equity since the beginning of the year, whether you were stubborn short-seller or a FOMO buyer. TSLA had run-up 400% since June but has fallen more than 20% since its high a couple of days ago.\n",
      "Tesla, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Tesla, Inc. Quote\n",
      "The stock is trading like Bitcoin did in 2018, but will this stock exhibit the same fall? Does TSLA have the fundaments to support its recent rally?\n",
      "What we have to consider when assessing the most recent price surge is what initiated it, and why did it accelerate in the fashion that it did? The price swell started with this electric vehicle giant reporting record delivery figure in the last three quarters of 2019, which unexpectedly met Elon’s ostentatious promise of 350,000 - 400,000 deliveries. The Shanghai Gigafactory has finished ahead of schedule, a Berlin Gigafactory is expected to start production by next year, the Model Y is being commercially produced ahead of schedule, and the company blew its Q4 estimates out of the water.\n",
      "Elon and his brainchild, Tesla, are finally keeping and exceeding their promises, something that this overzealous corporation has had a difficult time doing in the past.\n",
      "All this good news has been progressively priced-in over the past 8 months and has induced many short squeezes that have caused this stock to slingshot up. These hyperfast upward movements caused FOMO (fear of missing out) across the retail investing spectrum, and people rushed to get into this stock as it continued to skyrocket. Some persistent Tesla bears continue to put on short positions on the inclination that this stock couldn’t go up anymore only to be wrong, hit their loss limits, and be forced to repurchase the stock at a higher price for a loss. This is what we call a short squeeze, and it has further exacerbated the rally.\n",
      "Finally, TSLA appears to have hit a resistance level and has bounced hard off of it with gravity appearing to be pulling it back down to earth. I don’t think this stock has enough of a proven track record to be worth $160 billion, but its long term growth trajectory could make this stock one of the most valuable companies in the world – if it is able to continue keeping its promises.\n",
      "Comparables\n",
      "Tesla’s peak valuation was only $40 billion short of the largest automaker in the world, Toyota (TM), who sold 10.7 million cars in 2019, roughly 30 times as many cars as Tesla delivered last year. The primary difference is that Tesla sold 50% more vehicles in 2019 than the prior year, and Toyota sold only 1.4% more.\n",
      "The US’s Big 3 automakers Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) have had a tough few months. These firms have seen both declining sales and profitability in Q4. But does this have any bearing on how Tesla is doing or going to be doing? The answer is no. Tesla is undoubtedly taking market share from these companies, no matter how marginal and its growth trajectory appears to be uncorrelated with their performance.\n",
      "I would categorize this revolutionary EV enterprise as Tech and should be valued like any other fast-growing tech company. We should be comparing Tesla to companies like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), inventors, and pioneers of businesses that didn’t exist before they did.\n",
      "I am not going to say that EVs didn’t exist before Tesla, but it has indisputably put this space on the map. Tesla has made electric vehicles cool and is ahead of the competitive curve on almost everything it touches, whether its batteries, autonomous driving, or electric powertrain. If this EV giant is able to maintain its competitive positioning, it could lead the automotive world one day.\n",
      "When comparing TSLA with AMZN on an enterprise value to EBITDA metric, the companies are right in line with each other. TSLA is correcting itself down to its true fair value, which I believe sits around $700 at the moment.\n",
      "Take Away \n",
      "Tesla is making waves in the consumer and financial markets alike. If this firm can effectively penetrate the Chinese market and get the Berlin Gigafactory operational by next summer (as promised), TSLA shares will have a much more extensive upside\n",

      "The stock's gain on Monday comes after shares were beaten down in late February. Tesla stock fell about 30% from an all-time high achieved during the month. The stock's decline was primarily driven by some analyst downgrades and an overall market sell-off due to concerns about the coronavirus. It's possible, therefore, that some investors are simply buying shares because they believe the stock's recent sell-off went too far.\n",
      "Meanwhile, electric-vehicle news website Electrek is reporting that Tesla management is urging its North American sales team to deliver just as many cars in the market in Q1 as it did in Q4 -- a record quarter for the company. For this information, Electric is citing \"sources familiar with Tesla's U.S. sales.\"\n",
      "\"They are reporting strong demand in the first quarter and sources attribute it, at least partly, to the Cybertruck unveiling in November of last year,\" wrote Electrek. Hype surrounding the truck's unveiling may have helped drive interest for Tesla's overall vehicle lineup. Of course, the Cybertruck itself isn't expected to come to market until late 2021.\n",
      "For the full year of 2020, Tesla guided for deliveries to exceed 500,000 units. This compares to about 368,000 in 2019. However, the federal tax credit that qualifying Tesla buyers were eligible for in 2019 expired at the end of the year, so there have been concerns about how this might affect demand.\n",

      "Selesky cited better-than-expected fourth-quarter deliveries and the rapid construction and subsequent start of Model 3 production at Tesla's factory in China as key reasons for his optimism. \n",
      "Notably, Tesla delivered a record 112,000 vehicles in Q4, which were 6,000 more than analysts expected. The company also said it had \"demonstrated production run-rate capability of greater than 3,000 units per week [at our new factory in China], excluding local battery pack production which began in late December.\" \n",
      "Shares of Tesla have been surging in recent months as it became clear that the electric-car company was making substantial progress on its factory in China. The automaker started delivering China-made Model 3 units to employees at the end of December, and it began deliveries of these vehicles to customers in the market this week, serving as a catalyst for the stock's rise earlier this week. In total, shares are up 11% this week.\n",
      "Now Tesla will need to follow through on investors' high expectations and quickly ramp up production and deliveries in China.\n",

      "Last week I detailed a way for investors with a big accumulated profit in a stock to protect most of the gains using a “collar” in which they purchase a put and sell a call.\n",
      "I used Tesla (TSLA) as an example of a stock that had recently appreciated rapidly, but these same principles can be applied to a position in any stock.\n",
      "Analyst price targets vary wildly, with some predicting a steep fall and others remaining wildly bullish – with the possibility of doubling again in the immediate future.\n",
      "Obviously, no one knows exactly what’s going to happen with any certainty, but it’s likely that Tesla shares will remain volatile.\n",
      "Over the past week, they’ve tacked on an additional 6% and are now at or above the $425 strike of the call in the protective collar. This leave a trader with a decision to make.\n",
      "If Tesla stays above $425 through expiration, the shares will be called away. As an investor, if you’re happy with that level of profit and unsure about future performance, you can just let that happen.\n",
      "If you’re still bullish on the company long-term, you’ll have to do something to avoid selling the shares. I’ve explained this before, but it fits exactly in this current situation, so I’m going to repeat it. One of the best ways to preserve more appreciation potential is to roll the trade “up and out.”\n",
      "Here’s a recent article about that trade.\n",
      "There are a couple more things you might want to consider.\n",
      "First, you still own that 375 put. It up to you to decide whether you still want that protection or whether you’d rather sell it for whatever remaining value it has before time-decay renders it worthless.\n",
      "Second, assuming you have more than 100 shares – and therefore more than a one-lot options trade – you don’t have to trade the entire position the same way. In fact, for most investors who are unsure whether to hang on to a big winner or sell and take the profits, the most sensible answer is  to sell a portion of the position and keep the rest.\n",
      "In addition to simply being logical financial discipline, selling something around half of an appreciated position often has the psychological side effect of making a trader more objective about future decisions.\n",
      "Simply put, when you have a big winner, it can sometimes make you less of a trader and more of a cheerleader. You might want the stock to double or be up some certain percentage or you might fear the risk of selling out and seeing the shares continue to rip higher, knowing you left a lot of opportunity on the table.\n",
      "When you sell half, your expectations become much more manageable. Are you rooting for the stock to rally because you still have a long position? Of course.\n",
      "Will you feel smart if the stock falls, because you had the foresight to grab some easy profits at the top? Probably.\n",
      "Now that you have removed some of the emotional component – because now you’re actually a winner either way – you can stop “rooting” for anything and begin making rational decisions going forward about the current prospects for the stock and whether it belongs in your portfolio.\n",
      "If you’re sitting on an investment that has done well for you and you still love the stock, by all means keep it. If you’re even a bit unsure however, selling part of the position is probably a good idea. No one ever went broke selling half – and you might be surprised how good it feels.\n",

      "Tesla TSLA shares have surged 66% over the past month taking its valuation above that of General Motors GM, Volkswagen and Fiat Chrysler FCAU combined. Shorts are also at a one-year low of 15% (according to S3 data) as easy liquidity increased momentum in a stock that has seen a steady flow of positive news, including several upgrades and price target increases from sell-side analysts.\n",
      "\n",
      "And despite the soaring prices, the eccentric CEO Elon Musk (and foremost Tesla bull out there) increased his stake to 34.1 million shares or an 18.5% share of the company. And not one to pass up an opportunity, especially given the investments the company has scheduled to bring new models and factories online, he initiated another public share issue. Despite the resultant dilution, 2.65 million shares were lapped up and the deal's underwriters exercised in full the option to buy another 397,500 shares, netting $2.31 billion for the company.So the big question on everyone’s minds is this: how much higher can it go?Bernstein’s Toni Sacconaghi, seemed compelled to raise his price target to $730 from $325. While this is below current levels, the earlier target just doesn’t make sense any more. Especially given that the analyst believes Tesla’s addressable market will grow 30X over the next 20 years, so even if it loses half its market share, it will still grow 15X. He also sees additional opportunity in trucks, self-driving, battery technology and solar markets.Speaking of trucks, the Cybertrucks Owners Club is saying that the Tesla vehicle has received 522,764 preorders, which seems unlikely given its strange-looking design and demo faux pas that left it with a cracked window. Neither Tesla nor Musk has confirmed these numbers. The last time Musk said anything about it was in November, when he said 250,000 preorders had been received.“Investors feel much better about Tesla’s ability to be sustainably profitable; Model 3 demand remains healthy; [gross margins and operating expenditures] are both poised to materially improve... competition is sputtering; and product and production pipelines are robust,” says Sacconaghi. “We are skeptical that upside possibilities are likely to be expunged any time soon — suggesting no imminent negative catalysts for the stock.” “Notably, Tesla is the single fastest-growing large-cap tech stock today, and the scarcity of such a profile inevitably commands a premium, especially in this market,” he explains.Piper Sandler’s Alexander Potter and Winnie Dong are even more optimistic, raising their one-year price target from $729 to $928 a share. They seemed impressed with their own experiment of installing a solar-based system to charge a Model X.“It’s easy to forget that TSLA sells batteries and solar power products; after all, the segment was only 6% of sales in 2019,” they wrote in their note. “But management says that the solar+storage business will one day rival the automotive segment, and if this is true, then investors will eventually need to pay attention.”Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas raised his one-year price target to $1,200 on Tuesday, from the previous level of $650 a share as analyst calculations aren’t making sense any more and the opportunity appears immense.\n",
      "And that isn’t all. Seems some enthusiasts remembered Musk’s statement at the 2019 shareholder’s meeting that “It will not be long before we have a 400-mile range car.” Tesla has greater range than the competition anyway, but it’s been tweaking that with software improvements. Jason Hughes, a Tesla parts reseller while reverse engineering Tesla’s new battery management system (BMS) firmware has discovered that the new battery pack would bring a 400-mile range to some of its cars. Of course this means even more demand and so, more orders for the EV maker.ConclusionThe sky seems to be the limit for Tesla now. But there’s obviously a risk to the shares given the almost bubble-like rally. That’s why we have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating on the shares now.Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity.

      "tesla_news_31_Tesla_Expects_Record_Deliveries_in_Q4.htm\n",
      "Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have been on a tear recently. The stock is up 44% in the past six months. While the sharp rise is great for shareholders, it puts the pressure on for the company to execute during its fourth quarter. More specifically, investors should look for continued strong vehicle sales growth from the automaker to confirm that the automaker's growth story is intact.\n",
      "Fortunately, there are several reasons for investors to be optimistic that Tesla can do exactly this.\n",
      "Model 3. Image source: Tesla.\n",
      "Demand for Tesla's vehicles has steadily increased throughout the year -- and Q4 was no exception.\n",
      "\"Our global order rate remains strong and continues to increase,\" said Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn in the company's third-quarter earnings call. \"Despite increases to production levels, our order backlog has been growing, and quarter to date, orders are significantly higher than at this point in last quarter.\"\n",
      "This bodes well for the company to hit its quarterly and full-year guidance. Tesla said it expected deliveries to increase sequentially and to exceed 360,000 for the full year. This means the electric-car maker will need to deliver over 104,500 vehicles in Q4 -- a figure that implies a 7% sequential increase. That would put total deliveries in 2019 significantly ahead of the 246,000 vehicles it delivered in 2018.\n",
      "As has been the case for Tesla's previous vehicles, word-of-mouth marketing for Model 3 is proving effective.\n",
      "\"[W]hat we're seeing is that word of mouth is more than enough to drive our demand in excess of production. We have no plans to advertise at this time,\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said.\n",
      "Of course, Tesla does engage in significant sales efforts by opening stores in high foot-traffic areas, hosting occasional test-drive events, implementing referral programs, and utilizing other marketing tactics. Still, it's good to see Tesla reporting that word-of-mouth marketing remains a meaningful sales driver.\n",
      "While Model 3 deliveries have been rising sharply, sales of Tesla's higher-priced Model S and X have been concerning. After averaging about 25,000 combined Model S and X deliveries a quarter throughout both 2017 and 2018, sales of the two vehicles have been dropped significantly in 2019. In Tesla's third quarter, for instance, combined Model S and X deliveries were about 17,500, down 37% year over year and 1% sequentially.\n",
      "But Tesla management surprisingly indicated that deliveries of the two vehicles could move higher during Q4.\n",
      "\"[W]e are increasing production on our S and X lines for this quarter in response to increasing demand,\" said Kirkhorn during the call. He noted that while the Model 3's production ramp has consumed attention at the company up until this point, the recent stabilization of Model 3 production is allowing Tesla to focus more on the balance between its three vehicles. \"So, the delivery numbers in Q3 understated the interest in the product for that quarter,\" he explained. \"And we continue to see strength in the order rate, which we anticipate will be reflected in S and X deliveries in Q4.\"\n",
      "Given all these comments from management on recent demand trends, record total vehicle deliveries in Q4 seem likely.\n",

      "\"Based on our updated expectations for electric vehicle (EV) cost declines and demand, as well as our estimates for the potential profitability of robotaxis, our 2024 expected value per share for TSLA is $7,000,\" the investment firm said in a note to investors over the weekend. Tesla's robotaxi business is a self-driving taxi service that CEO Elon Musk hopes it can launch in the coming years as it upgrades its fleet of vehicles via over-the-air software updates so that they can become self-driving.\n",
      "The service, of course, is highly dependent on regulatory approval and is largely considered speculative to any investment thesis at this point. As part of the robotaxi service, Musk expects Tesla owners to be able to deploy their vehicles into the automated fleet and share revenue generated from rides with Tesla.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Argus analyst William Selesky boosted his 12-month price target on the shares from $556 to $808, citing the company's strong fourth-quarter results, management's forecast for more than 500,000 deliveries this year, and Tesla's leading position in the fast-growing EV market.\n",

      "A lot of things seem to be going Elon Musk’s way lately. His recent victory in a defamation lawsuit filed against him by a rescue diver that he insulted on Twitter was a personal matter and really had nothing to do with his role as CEO of today’s Bull of the Day – Tesla (TSLA), but he was able to seamlessly blend his personal and public personas recently when he drove a prototype of Tesla’s upcoming CyberTruck out to dinner at a hip LA restaurant.\n",
      "As the old adage goes: \"Any press is good press.\"\n",
      "For a company that spends exactly zero on advertising, Tesla gets a great deal of free publicity, largely from the exploits of its charismatic leader. Getting extensive paparazzi coverage while celebrities fawn over your latest innovation is the kind of free advertising that ordinary companies can only dream of.\n",
      "Even when the attention has a negative aspect – like the infamous broken windows on the CyberTruck at its unveiling in November – it splashes Tesla’s name and product images all over the news. The window issue will certainly be remedied (probably to an extreme degree, knowing Musk), but the extensive media coverage was simply more free advertising.\n",
      "Isolated – and some would argue, inevitable – accidents involving Tesla vehicles being operated in auto-pilot mode even end up bolstering the company’s reputation. It’s all in the spin. Those news stories make the public aware just how close Tesla is getting to true autonomous driving.\n",
      "It’s more than free advertising that’s going right for Tesla lately, however. Impressive sales of existing products, aggressive expansion efforts that will allow the company to manufacture and sell its autos and batteries in Europe and Asia and a stable of exciting future products have made Tesla one of the hottest stocks of 2019, with the shares nearly doubling in price since the beginning of June.\n",
      "The rally was already developing when Tesla turned in a blowout Q3 earnings report in October. Expected to post a modest loss of ($0.15)/share for the quarter, Tesla instead posted a positive net of $1.86/share on $6.3B in revenue.\n",
      "The company reported capital expenditures of $385 million during the quarter, down from $510M in the third quarter of 2018. Free cash flow was $371 million and cash and equivalents on the balance sheet grew to $5.3 billion, largely extinguishing fears that the company would have to tap the debt markets at unfavorable rates or engage in a dilutive equity offering to raise the cash to fund near-term operations.\n",
      "There was a lot more to like in the investor presentation following the earnings release. Tesla sold 97,000 cars in the Q3, displaying still-strong demand for its most affordable variant – the Model 3. That car now starts at a retail price of just $39,500, which is a bit higher than the $35K selling price that the company targeted when the project was unveiled in 2016, but still well within the reach of the average new car customer.\n",
      "Musk reiterated that Tesla is on track to deliver close to 400,000 vehicles in 2019, which is still far fewer than huge manufacturers like Ford – which sold 2.5M cars in 2018 – but still signifies that Tesla has evolved from a niche automaker to a true mass-market brand.\n",
      "That Tesla sales number also promises to keep growing. Only 600,000 of Ford’s sales were passenger cars, while 867K were SUVs and 1.12M were pickup trucks – two categories at which Tesla is taking dead aim. Musk reported that the company would begin selling the affordable Model Y SUV in the summer of 2020 – 6 months sooner than previously expected, and at better gross margins than existing models.\n",
      "The recent debut of the CyberTruck prototype promises an all-electric full size competitor to the best-selling Ford F-150 that will be in production by late 2021. Tesla received 250,000 pre-orders for the truck during the first weekend after the unveiling event, 41% of which were for the high end tri-motor variant that’s expected to sell for almost $70K. The more basic single-motor rear-wheel drive truck will start at $39K.\n",
      "The Bull of the Day is generally a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stock and Tesla is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). That rank has recently come up after a slew of analyst upgrades and positive earnings revisions. Since the Q3 report, the consensus estimate for Q4 rose from ($0.28) to $0.90/share, full-year 2019 rose from ($3.00) to ($0.50)/share and 2020 estimates went from $4.86 to $5.73/share.\n",
      "It’s considered a foregone conclusion that fully electric vehicles will some day supplant gasoline powered cars, but it was far from clear that Tesla would survive to lead that revolution to fruition.\n",
      "Make no mistake about it, recent results suggest that other aspirants in the electric auto market are going to have to keep chasing Tesla for the foreseeable future.\n",

      "Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) new Cybertruck was met with skepticism when it was unveiled last week. Nevertheless, many consumers seem to have warmed up to the vehicle, with reservations rising to 250,000 units less than a week after the truck's unveiling. It's a different story with Wall Street analysts, however.\n",
      "For the most part, the Street doesn't seem to be convinced that the radically designed fully electric vehicle will generate meaningful sales volume. But one analyst is making a bold bet this week, predicting the Cybertruck will sell in volumes of around 200,000 units per year. Further, the analyst is upping his price target for Tesla stock.\n",
      "Cybertruck. Image source: Tesla.\n",
      "Piper Jaffray analyst Alexander Potter boosted his 12-month price target for Tesla shares from $372 to $423 on Tuesday. The analyst said Tesla is a \"must-own stock,\" citing the company's recent demonstration of sustained high-volume manufacturing, \"impressive\" operating expense control, and \"frugal\" capital spending.\n",
      "It's true that Tesla's financials have been improving recently as the automaker keeps its expenses in check. Tesla generated $371 million in free cash flow in its most recent quarter, and management indicated in its third-quarter update that it believes its business \"has grown to the point of being self-funding.\"\n",
      "The most interesting comments from the analyst, however, were related to Tesla's recently launched truck. Potter says he has warmed up to the vehicle after initially questioning its appeal to consumers. Now he's forecasting 200,000 Cybertruck deliveries per year beginning in 2023.\n",
      "Potter's predicted sales volume for Tesla's new truck might actually be possible.\n",
      "While 200,000 Cybertrucks per year is enough to move the needle for Tesla, it's not a particularly aggressive forecast. After all, Tesla's annualized Model 3 deliveries are quickly closing in on 300,000 units.\n",
      "Further, Potter's timeline is reasonable considering Tesla is planning to begin production of the vehicle around the end of 2021. This means Tesla will have more than a year to ramp up production to a level high enough to hit 200,000 vehicles per year. Given Tesla's experience with high-volume Model 3 production, it wouldn't be surprising to see the electric-car maker achieve production levels high enough to support 200,000 deliveries per year by 2023.\n",
      "Though Tesla could very well fulfill Potter's forecast, investors should tread carefully when it comes to predicting the potential of new products. Until Tesla provides more insight into demand for the vehicle and production plans, investors should avoid speculation about how the truck could help Tesla's business.\n",

      "Cybertruck, which is designed to have the utility of a truck and the performance of a sports car, is made of cold-rolled stainless steel.\n",
      "The company offers the vehicle in three variants. A single motor Rear-Wheel Drive will cost $39,900, and will have a towing capacity of 7,500 pounds and more than 250 miles of range. Further, Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive or AWD is priced at $49,900, will have a towing capacity of more than 10,000 pounds, with more than 300 miles of range. The third version Tri Motor AWD is priced at $69,900 and will have a towing capacity of 14,000 pounds and battery range of more than 500 miles.\n",
      "Tesla said customers can book the vehicle with a $100 deposit, fully refundable. They will be able to complete configuration as production nears in late 2021. Tri Motor AWD production is expected to begin in late 2022.\n",
      "The vehicles can be charged at home, at Destination Charging locations, and with Tesla's network of more than 14,000 Superchargers.\n",

      "Tesla's Cybertruck was in development for some years. Musk earlier had described the pickup model as futuristic-like cyberpunk with crazy features, and that it would outperform Ford F-150, the top selling pickup truck in America at present.\n",
      "Ford is planning an electric F-150 truck, while General Motors would bring an electric pickup truck to market in 2021. Further, Rivian is expected to begin the production of its electric R1T pickup truck in the second half of 2020. \n"

      "This time around, Wall Street analysts expect mixed earnings results, thanks to trade issues and concerns about an economic slowdown. But, today three big-brand American stocks are poised to come up with promising earnings results. These stocks possess stable cash flows and have established business models, which will certainly boost their profit margins.\n",
      "Let us, thus, take a look at some of the big-brand companies set to beat earnings in one of the busiest earnings stretches this season. It’s worth pointing out that these stocks have a positive Earnings ESP. This is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. It provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n",
      "Microsoft\n",
      "Trillion-dollar plus company, Microsoft Corporation MSFT is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2020 results, after market close. The biggest cloud computing company has impressed investors with solid growth in the past decade. In fact, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the company’s revenues jumped 12% year over year, courtesy of an uptick in commercial cloud revenues.\n",
      "During the fiscal fourth quarter, commercial cloud revenues soared 39% year over year. In particular, Azure cloud platform’s revenues climbed 64% annually. Azure’s encouraging growth is expected to have continued in the fiscal first quarter.\n",
      "Other segments of commercial cloud including Office 365 and Dynamics 365 are also expected to have driven the software giant’s earnings. Needless to say, Microsoft’s commercial Office and Dynamics’ revenues increased 14% and 12%, respectively, on an annual basis in the fiscal fourth quarter.\n",
      "The PC industry, by the way, is doing pretty well this year. According to research firm IDC, PC shipments increased 3% annually in the third quarter to 70.4 million. Another research firm Gartner also estimated a 1.1% rise in PC shipments to 68.1 million. Thus, it’s expected that Microsoft has made the most of the increase in PC sales in the fiscal first quarter.\n",
      "Analysts now expect the company’s EPS to increase to $1.25 from $1.14 a year ago. Revenues are expected to jump from $29.08 billion to $32.23 billion. Presently, the company has an Earnings ESP of +0.31%.\n",

The electric car company has of late shown impressive growth in vehicle sales, mostly driven by its low-cost Model 3. But, the question is whether the low-priced vehicle will be able to single-handily boost the company’s profit margin.\n",
      "Tesla has announced that it has delivered a record 97,000 vehicles in the third quarter, and almost 80,000 of these vehicles were Model 3. Such figures are, undoubtedly, higher than any other quarter so far. What’s more, production has gone up with nearly 10,000 more vehicles in the second quarter.\n",
      "Wall Street analysts expect the company’s third-quarter revenues at $6.6 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter loss per share has also been narrowed by 2 cents in the past 30 days. And our proprietary model predicts an earnings beat for Tesla this time around. Tesla has an Earnings ESP of +79.68%.\n",

Its shares jumped more than 10% after first-quarter earnings release, while the stock lost more than 7% following second-quarter numbers. So, all eyes are now on third-quarter earnings results to track the stock’s movement post release.\n",
      "Its vehicle sales have slightly declined in the United States this year. Tight supplies of the 2020 Explorer SUV have been cited to be the primary reason behind this decline in sales figures. But, investors shouldn’t worry! Ford stated that sales in the European market, led by Focus, rose 3.1% in the third quarter. In comparison, Ford lost nearly $245 million in the European market in the same period last year.\n",
      "Ford also stated that its sales in China were up 5% in September from August and 25% compared to July. Most importantly, its Lincoln brand’s September sales jumped 11% and 13% from August and July, respectively.\n",
      "The promising sales performance hints at a solid third quarter for Ford. The Zacks Consensus Estimate, Ford for the company’s EPS is pegged at 26 cents on revenues of $34.17 billion. Ford currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.74%.\n",

      "The stock of electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) may be the most controversial in the market. Founded in 2003 and a public company since 2010, Tesla is the first new car company in the U.S. to go public since 1956. As you might have heard by now, Tesla's entrance has shaken up the entire U.S. and global auto industry by making electric vehicles \"cool.\" But its disrupter status has also attracted a fair amount of naysayers, who point to the company's lack of profitability as it tries to upend an entire established industry from scratch.\n",
      "Tesla made its initial big splash with the luxury Roadster in 2008,  then followed up this concept car with the 2012 release of the Model S, a high-end sedan at prices starting around $75,000. Three years later, in 2015, Tesla released the Model X, a luxury SUV starting at just over $80,000. But the biggest product release came in mid-2017, when Tesla released its first mass-market vehicle,the Model 3, which starts at $35,000. The next model will be the Model Y, a crossover vehicle, or \"CUV,\" which will have a slightly higher price than the Model 3, but will also be more profitable. Its production is set for the fall of 2020. Then there are also plans for a future Tesla pickup truck and a Tesla semitruck as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "So if you're an investor thinking about purchasing Tesla's stock, how should you think about the company? While many on Wall Street tend to focus on each quarter's deliveries, that probably isn't the best way to look at Tesla as a long-term investment. Here are four charts that show Tesla's huge accomplishments, its potential risks, and the state of the business from a 10,000-foot view.\n",
      "Tesla's Model 3 is the key to understanding its recent financials. Image source: Tesla.\n",
      "\n",
      "TSLA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n",
      "\n",
      "As you can see, Tesla has executed incredible revenue growth over the past five years, growing over sevenfold, from just $3.2 billion in sales in 2014 to $24.9 billion over the 12 months ended in June.  As you can also see, much of the gain has come in the past two years, as production of the mass-market Model 3 rose to meet high demand. Last quarter, Tesla grew its automotive revenue 44%. \n",
      "However, as you'll also see, the massive increase in Model 3 units hasn't come easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "TSLA Net PP&E (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n",
      "\n",
      "Here you can see the big increase in Tesla's capital spending during 2017 as it built its giant \"Gigafactory\" in Nevada, production capabilities in Fremont, California, for the Model 3, and new service centers and infrastructure to support the influx of new customers from a mass-market vehicle.\n",
      "Higher spending produced an increased debt load, including secured senior notes as well as convertible debt -- a point on which Tesla bears tend to focus.  However, as you can also see, many of these expenditures were one-offs, or at least elevated compared to Tesla's baseline levels of spending. In addition, the company's net debt has begun to flatten out -- at least for now.\n",
      "Of course, 2018 didn't mark the end of Tesla's capital spending, as it will soon be expanding into Model Y production and moving its China Gigafactory toward higher production levels this year. However, according to management, capital expenditures for 2019 will be only $1.5 billion to $2 billion, down from previous guidance, and down from $2.3 billion in 2018 and the high of $3.4 billion in 2017.  Even more encouraging is that management claims it isn't putting off any projects, but rather finding more efficiencies in its construction and manufacturing processes due to past experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "TSLA Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts\n",
      "\n",
      "As spending went up, you can also see that the Model 3 has hit Tesla's margins. That's not only because the Model 3 has lower gross margins than the Model X and Model S, but also because of the high fixed costs needed to mass-produce a car. Like capital spending, Tesla's net losses have piled up over the past year; however, as the company is now reaching scale, you can also see that its net losses are narrowing. So while Tesla's net income is still firmly in the negative, it's moving in the right direction.\n",
      "Additionally, you may also notice the more encouraging sign on the bottom part of the graph: soaring (and positive!) free cash flow in 2019. Tesla has achieved positive free cash as capital expenditures have come down and sales have surged. However, before you get too excited, beware of a big asterisk next to that cash flow story.\n",
      "\n",
      "TSLA Working Capital (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla calculates free cash flow as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures, but embedded in that operating cash flow story are both earnings and changes in working capital. Working capital includes inventory and accounts receivable, which use cash, subtracted from accrued liabilities and salaries, which produce cash, as they are costs that have not yet been paid. In Tesla's case, it really ramped up production in the latter half of 2018, but also generated lots of cash by incurring negative working capital -- basically, increasing its accrued liabilities and payables to suppliers.\n",
      "That longer payment schedule may have been perfectly legitimate, as suppliers often agree to longer payment schedules for bigger and bigger payments, which Tesla incurred as it ramped up Model 3 production. However, investors shouldn't take this increase in operating cash as the norm -- a big increase in payables to suppliers and employees is more like a short-term loan than actual cash generation, and eventually these employees and suppliers will have to be paid.\n",
      "The overall picture for Tesla is one of a company that has reached the summit of a huge production ramp for the Model 3 -- a very impressive feat. Now that this big spending period has ended, it looks as if net losses are turning the corner and could even turn into gains soon.\n",
      "However, bulls shouldn't be celebrating just yet. As the company's dip into working capital last year showed, Tesla is pulling all sorts of minor miracles to keep its debt-fueled mass production ramp going, and the company is not done introducing new models, even though it's not yet profitable. After all, the company just raised even more convertible debt and issued equity in May to fatten its balance sheet.\n",
      "Investors need to figure out if Tesla can continue its massive revenue growth without as much expense growth or the need for more capital. It will be hard to figure out, as the Model 3 is growing and maturing while the Model Y and China Gigafactory will also be ramping up their production levels at the same time. Therefore, investors should try to isolate the economics of just the Model 3, and filter out the new \"growth\" spending on future vehicle makes. Hopefully, management can separate these different buckets of spending for investors.  \n",

      "First, let’s point out that Tesla shocked investors two weeks ago by reporting an unexpected profit. Analysts had been looking for a loss of $0.24 per share, but the number came in at profit of $1.91 per share.\n",
      "Tesla soared 30% in the wake of the announcement, and has held a good chunk of those gains in the subsequent weeks.\n",
      "Now, Eric’s analysis came before this earnings surprise, so it’s based on Tesla’s then-share-price of about $260. So, keep in mind the 23% price tag increase as we proceed …\n",
      "Eric begins his analysis by looking at overall valuations relative to some competitors:\n",
      "At the current quote of $260, the stock market says Tesla Inc. (TSLA) is worth about $46.5 billion. This sizable sum is greater than the market values of either Ford Motor Co. (F) or BMW AG (BMWYY), and it’s just slightly less than the combined market values of Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. (NSANY) and Porsche SE (POAHY).\n",
      "These comparisons are somewhat surprising, given Tesla’s prodigious loss-making “power.” The company has racked up more than $3 billion in losses over the last two years. By contrast, Ford, BMW, Nissan, and Porsche have all racked up billions in profit during that time frame.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "So, despite Tesla’s swing to profits two weeks ago, we have a company that has burned through $3 billion in recent years … yet one that is more richly-valued than four established, consistently-profitable auto manufacturers.\n",
      "We’d also be remiss not to mention that the earnings surprise has several question marks. For example, automotive revenue was down 12% (shockingly, revenues here in the U.S. collapsed 39%), total revenue was down 8%, free cash flow was down 58%, and total debt was up 12%. So, camouflaged by the swing to profits are some alarming other metrics.\n",
      "But …\n",
      "Tesla is a groundbreaking first-mover in its industry. Does that warrant additional leeway with its financials? If so, does that make it the right play for the Second Electric Revolution?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "***Tesla? Or its picks and shovels component makers?\n",
      "Tesla does not exist in a vacuum. Like virtually all other companies, Tesla requires parts and components sourced from 3rd-party suppliers.\n",
      "Here’s Eric on this:\n",
      "…Tesla needs the electricity that renewable energy companies produce. Tesla also needs the “stuff” natural resources companies produce. It needs copper, nickel, graphite, and lithium. But Tesla is on the cash-paying side of this transaction, whereas mining and renewable energy companies are on the cash-receiving side.\n",
      "With this in mind, might these mining and renewable “picks and shovels” companies be better for our investment dollars?\n",
      "In Eric’s issue, he walks through the valuation of seven specific mining/renewable companies. As one example, there’s Antofagasta (ANFGF). It’s a Chilean copper producer with a market cap of nearly $11 billion.\n",
      "Eric points out that many of the stocks in these two sectors are trading well below their all-time highs. Some of them are downright depressed.\n",
      "Thanks in large part to this, a well-capitalized investor could buy all seven of these smaller companies for the same amount of money that Tesla is worth — and again, this was before Tesla’s recent 23% price surge.\n",
      "But if we’re questioning Tesla’s worth as an investment, let’s be fair and question these other plays too. After all, the low valuation of these seven companies doesn’t necessarily mean they’re a “buy.”\n",
      "From Eric:\n",
      "Obviously, “cheap” is not synonymous with “buy.” Just because you could sell Tesla and buy all seven of these companies doesn’t mean you should. Many of the stocks in the resources sector, for example, are depressed for a reason.\n",
      "Demand has failed to match supply in most commodity markets. That’s why the resources sector has been suffering a fierce bear market for most of the last 10 years …\n",
      "Nevertheless, as poor as the recent earnings results in the resources sector have been, the operating earnings of the (these seven plays) are still much, much larger than those of Tesla. Infinitely larger, actually.\n",
      "Over the last 12 months, Tesla produced over half a billion dollars’ worth of net income … a negative half billion, that is!\n",
      "Over the same time frame, (the seven plays) produced combined net income of $1 billion. That may not sound like a huge success, but at least it’s a number with a plus sign in front of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "***But Tesla’s valuation is all about the future!\n",
      "That’s how many Tesla bulls may respond.\n",
      "Okay, but let’s be realistic — the days of Tesla being the only game in town are nearing an end. From GM to Porsche, competitors are now entering the electric vehicle space, offering real alternatives.\n",
      "On this note, as I write, news is out that Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot owner PSA Group are merging — to the tune of $50 billion.\n",
      "Yes, Tesla made electric vehicles “cool” and it’s the undeniable market leader. But as competition heats up, it’s ushering in a new dog-eat-dog environment that Tesla has yet to experience. After all, Porsche is pretty cool too.\n",
      "Here’s how Eric described this:\n",
      "Tesla’s lavish valuation draws much of its justification from the idea that the company is a groundbreaking innovator …\n",
      "Therefore, the thinking goes, investors must price in the company’s brilliant future, rather than its underwhelming present.\n",
      "Maybe so, but Tesla’s loss-making present is a known, whereas its brilliant future is simply a guess. And this guess looks increasingly dubious, as every automaker on the planet retools to launch EVs of its own.\n",
      "The onslaught of competing EV models that is coming to market over the next two years is truly breathtaking. Tesla will struggle to repel this onslaught.\n",
      "Given these headwinds, you could make a strong argument that the right way to play the Second Electric Revolution isn’t Tesla — or any specific electric vehicle manufacturer for that matter. After all, they will all be operating in the same cut-throat market.\n",
      "Instead, perhaps the wiser play will be that will sell to all these manufacturers, regardless of whether any particular one succeeds or fails. At the end of the day, each of these manufacturers will be needing the same copper, nickel, graphite, and lithium.\n",
      "As we wrap up, whether you love or hate Tesla, you have to admire and respect it. This company has changed the game in the automotive world. But that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the right horse for your investment dollars as arrives.\n",
      "I’ll give Eric the last word:\n",
      "(Telsa) is an undisputed innovator, but that doesn’t mean it will survive to lead the new era it has spearheaded. “First movers” like Tesla often succumb to the creative energies they unleash. Names like Betamax, Blackberry, Napster, and MySpace come to mind …\n",
      "So, I say: Why not sell Tesla and buy the dynamic companies that will power and nurture the Second Electric Revolution?\n",
      "Have a good evening,\n",

      "Shares of electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) jumped 9.5% on Friday. The stock's gain follows an even bigger gain on Thursday. Shares are up nearly 29% in two days.\n",
      "Optimism for the stock over the last two days follows the company's surprise third-quarter profit. The company's bottom line and free cash flow were both much better than expected during the period.\n",
      "Friday's gain, specifically, is likely due in part to news that several bearish Tesla analysts raised their price targets for the stock, as well as a continuing short squeeze as short-sellers cover their short positions.\n",
      "Image source: Tesla.\n",
      "Tesla's third-quarter revenue was about in line with analyst estimates. But its non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share came in at $1.86 -- far ahead of analysts' average forecast for a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.42. In addition, management reiterated that it believes its business has scaled to the point of being self-funding.\n",
      "Following the surprise profit, some analysts with the lowest price targets on Tesla stock lifted their outlooks. Barclay's analyst Brian Johnson increased his target from $150 to $200; Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy boosted his target from $189 to $200; and JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman boosted his target from $200 to $220. Their price targets, of course, still imply downside from the growth stock's current price of $328. But an improved outlook from prominent bears may have spooked some short-sellers and prompted them to cover their positions.\n",
      "For now, Tesla will need to execute well during its important holiday quarter. In order for the company to achieve its guidance to deliver 360,000 or more deliveries during 2019, the automaker will need to deliver about 105,000 vehicles during the period. This would be a quarterly record for the company.\n",
      "Looking further out, Tesla will have to prove that it can remain profitable and truly be able to self-fund its business.\n",

      "In its third quarter, the electric-car company reported non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $1.86 -- well ahead of an average analyst estimate for a loss per share of $0.42. Free cash flow similarly crushed analyst estimates, coming in at $371 million. On average, analysts had expected Tesla to report free cash flow of $32 million. \n",
      "Another quarter of meaningful free cash flow helps ease concerns about the automaker's ability to be self-funding. The company has now reported positive free cash flow in four of the past five quarters, with trailing-12-month free cash flow of $975 million.\n",
      "Looking ahead, management said it expects full-year deliveries to exceed the low end of its guidance range laid out at the beginning of the year for 360,000 to 400,000 units. The low end of this guidance range implies 45% year-over-year growth in deliveries.\n",
      "In addition, management had upbeat news on its Shanghai factory, noting that trial production of the Model 3 is underway. Further, Tesla said it expects its Model Y to launch by summer 2020.\n",
